# Project Title:

### Course Registration System Simulation

# Description:

### This project simulates a course registration system developed as part of an advanced programming course. The primary objective was to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Java. The system allows students to register for courses, view available courses, and manage their schedules while incorporating basic validation for course capacities and prerequisites.

# Features:

### Student registration: Add students to the system.
### Course management: Create and update courses with attributes such as course name, instructor, capacity, and prerequisites.
### Registration process: Students can enroll in available courses while ensuring capacity limits and prerequisites are respected.
### Schedule conflict handling: Prevents students from enrolling in courses that have schedule conflicts.
### Admin functionality: Allows admins to manage course offerings, view student enrollments, and resolve conflicts.

# Technologies Used:

### Java
### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
### Java Collections (ArrayList, HashMap)
### Exception handling for managing invalid operations (e.g., capacity full, conflicting schedules)
### Simple text-based user interface
